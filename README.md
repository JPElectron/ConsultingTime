Click the options icon in the lower right to set preferences such as:

Always on top
...the Consulting Time window will always be the top most window.
Warn for multiple timers
...prompts with a message box if more than one timer is started.
Disallow multiple timers
...stops a previously running timer if another is started.

Notify every XX minutes
...with a PC beep or by playing the referenced wave file.
Wave files should be located in the same working directory as the
program executable (usually C:\Program Files\Consulting Time\) and
typed in the field as: filename.wav

Options and window position are saved when the program is closed.
